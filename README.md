## 🔍 URL Validation

The project includes a validation script to ensure all organization ideas URLs are safe and properly formatted:

```bash
node agent/scripts/validate-ideas-urls.js
```

This script checks:
- ✅ URL format validity
- ✅ Protocol restrictions (http/https only)
- ⚠️ Placeholder/generic URLs that need updating
- 📊 Summary statistics and protocol distribution

Run this before committing changes to `src/js/org.js` to catch invalid URLs early.

## 🚀 Deploy Your Own

### 1. Fork & Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gsoc-2026-org-finder.git
cd gsoc-2026-org-finder
```

### 2. Add GitHub Token (for live stats + Good First Issues)
In your Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN = ghp_your_token_here
```
Generate a token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) — only `public_repo` scope needed.

### 3. Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```
Or connect the repo to Vercel and it deploys automatically on every push.

### 4. Run Locally
```bash
open index.html   # macOS — works without API (GitHub stats won't load)
```
For full functionality locally, run `vercel dev` to start the Edge Function.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**GitHub stats not loading?**
- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- Check rate limits: `curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/rate_limit`

**Ideas link not working?**
- Run `node agent/scripts/validate-ideas-urls.js` to check all URLs

**Issues page empty?**
- GitHub API might be rate-limited; wait 1 hour and refresh

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a missing org, wrong category, or incorrect tags? PRs are very welcome!

1. Fork the repo
2. Edit the `ORGS` array in `index.html`
3. Open a pull request

Each org entry looks like this:

```js
{
  name: "Organization Name",
  cat: "science",           // science | programming | data | web | os | security | media | infra | dev | other
  years: 5,                 // number of GSoC years participated
  firstYear: 2021,          // first year they participated
  competition: "moderate",  // hot | moderate | chill
  github: "owner/repo",     // main repo (or just "owner" for umbrella orgs)
  ideas: "https://github.com/org/repo/wiki/Ideas",  // project ideas page URL (optional)
  tags: ["python", "c++", "machine learning"],
  desc: "Short description of what the org does.",
  fit: ["Python devs", "ML researchers"]
}
```

**Ideas URL Requirements**:
- Must use `http://` or `https://` protocol (or protocol will be added automatically)
- Should link to the organization's specific project ideas page
- Generic GSoC organization pages are acceptable as placeholders but should be updated when possible
- Run `node agent/scripts/validate-ideas-urls.js` to check all URLs before submitting

**Competition levels** (subjective, based on org popularity + slot count):
- `hot` — high applicant volume, very competitive (Django, LLVM, Git, KDE…)
- `moderate` — good balance of applicants and slots
- `chill` — fewer applicants, easier to stand out

## 🔌 API Reference (`/api/github.js`)

The Edge Function proxies GitHub API calls so your token never hits the client.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/github?repo=owner/repo` | Repo stats: stars, forks, issues, last commit, activity, GFI count |
| `GET /api/github?repo=owner/repo&gfi=1` | Good First Issue count only (faster, cached separately) |
| `GET /api/github?repo=owner/repo&gfi=1&issues=1` | Full list of up to 30 open Good First Issues |

All responses are cached in-memory for **1 hour** on the Edge runtime.

## We thank all our Contributors for improving this project

## 💡 Tips for Users

1. **New to GSoC?** Start with "Newcomers First" filter + sort by Good First Issues
2. **Experienced?** Check "Veterans" filter + sort by Competition for challenges
3. **Building a comparison?** Use keyboard shortcut `C` to quickly add orgs
4. **Mobile browsing?** Try portrait mode — everything scrolls smoothly
